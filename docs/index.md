# Preface

In the past years, I have maintained several starter boilerplate projects for Jakarta EE developers, including:

* [Jakarta EE 8 Starter Boilerplate](https://github.com/hantsy/jakartaee8-starter-boilerplate)
* [Jakarta EE 9 Starter Boilerplate](https://github.com/hantsy/jakartaee9-starter-boilerplate) 
* [Jakarta EE 9 Servlet Starter Boilerplate](https://github.com/hantsy/jakartaee9-servlet-starter-boilerplate)(only for Servlet containers, such as Jetty, Apache Tomcat). 

With these starter boilerplate projects, it is easy to start a new Jakarta EE project with SDLC/DevOps support. 

Jakarta EE 10 was released for a few months, the most popular application servers, such as GlassFish v7, WildFly 27/28.x, OpenLiberty 23.0.0.4, etc. have been aligned with the newest Jakarta EE 10 specification. I think it is time to update the existing [Jakarta EE 9 Starter Boilerplate](https://github.com/hantsy/jakartaee9-starter-boilerplate), and provide an update for Jakarta EE 10.

The new [Jakarta EE 10 Starter Boilerplate](https://github.com/hantsy/jakartaee10-starter-boilerplate) project is hosted on Github.

The initial work of this new Jakarta EE 10 Starter Boilerplate is already configured for three most popular open-source application servers: 

* [Eclipse GlassFish](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish)
* [WildFly](https://www.wildfly.org/)
* [OpenLiberty](https://www.openliberty.org/)

Others, such as Apache TomEE, etc. will be updated in future when it is updated to Jakarta EE 10.
