# Prerequisites

To explore and run the sample codes provided in the starter boilerplate, I assume you have installed the following software.

## Git

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and Git GUI tools, such as TortoiseGit, GitHub Desktop, etc.

Optionally install [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/) if you prefer using command/shell instead of the GUI tools.

# JDK 17

Although Jakarta EE 10 uses Java 11 as baseline, and also supports Java 17. But it is recommended to use to the latest LTS version as possible when you are starting a new project.

There are several JDK redistributions available in these days, choose your favoraite from the following list. 

* [OpenJDK]( https://openjdk.java.net)
* [Oracle JDK]( https://java.oracle.com)
* [Temurin OpenJDK]( https://adoptium.net/)
* [Zulu OpenJDK](https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/) by Azul
* [Microsoft OpenJDK](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk)
* [BellSoft Liberica JDK](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads)

Additionally, IBM, Amazon, Alibaba, RedHat have maintained their own Java redistributions. 

My preferred is Temurin, it is envoved from the former AdoptOpenJDK which is a 100% community-support project.

## Apache Maven 

Install the latest [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org), make sure you have added *MAVEN_INSTALLDIR/bin* to the system PATH environment variable.

## Java Editor or IDE 

Choose your favorite editors and IDE when starting codes.

* [VSCdoe](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java), do not forget to install Java code pack.
* [Intellij IDEA Communitiy Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)(free)
* [Apache NetBeans](http://netbeans.apache.org)
